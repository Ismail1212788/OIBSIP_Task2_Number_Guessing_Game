The "Number Guessing Game" is a delightful and straightforward Java project that offers an entertaining experience for users. In this engaging game, the computer selects a random number within a specified range, typically from 1 to 100. The user is presented with a dialogue box where they can enter their guess. The computer then provides feedback, informing the user whether their guess matches the generated number or if it's higher or lower. This interactive process continues until the user successfully guesses the number or decides to conclude the game. For those seeking to enhance the gameplay, options like limiting the number of attempts, introducing additional rounds, displaying a score, or awarding points based on the number of attempts can be seamlessly incorporated. This project not only offers an enjoyable experience but also serves as an excellent introduction to basic programming concepts in Java.
